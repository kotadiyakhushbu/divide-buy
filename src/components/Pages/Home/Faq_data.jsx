        Faq_title:"How are payments made?",
        Faq_contation:"Payments are collected via a Continuous Payment Authority (CPA). A continuous payment authority (CPA) is a recurring payment that we set up using your payment card details. As part of this process, we ask your permission (‘standing authority’) to take payments as and when they’re due. We collect payments automatically on the date your instalment is due.",

        Faq_title:"Will I be accepted for credit?",
        Faq_contation:"We cannot advise what your credit decision will be without you completing the online application. Most of our retail partners offer a pre-approval/soft credit search option before checkout, which will give you a good indication of what the credit decision may be before fully committing to a purchase and without impacting your credit score. Look out for the pre-approval option on the retailers website.",

        Faq_contation:"We may add fees and interest to your account if you miss a payment. Please see your credit agreement for further information. If you have any concerns about making a payment, please contact us on live chat here. Any missed payment may affect your credit file so please speak to us if you have any concerns.",

        Faq_contation:"The value and quantity of the orders you can place is dependent on several factors. As a responsible lender we aim to ensure that you get the right credit decision based on your circumstances. When you apply for interest free credit, we perform different searches to check your financial status.",

        id:5,
        Faq_title:"Are there any interest charges or fees to pay?",
        Faq_contation:"There is no APR or hidden charges. We do reserve the right to add late payment fees and interest to your account in the event of missed payments. This is explained in your credit agreement before you electronically sign at checkout.",

        id:6,
        Faq_title:"Do I need to make a payment to complete the order?",
        Faq_contation:"Yes. Your first instalment is always required to place an order. Subject to status, you may be required to pay a deposit alongside your first monthly instalment. This will reduce your monthly payments accordingly.",
